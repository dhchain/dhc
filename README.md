# Distributed Hash Chain
Distributed hash chain or DHC is an extension of blockchain structure first implemented in bitcoin. The goal of DHC is  to improve scalability of standard blockchain. 
One approach to improve scalability is to use sharding where instead of single blockchain there are multiple blockchains that store different sets of transactions and they are synchronized between each other in some way.
DHC has a single blockchain but each node only stores a subset of transactions in a given block.
